# ParityBits_3P71
        1. Even number of ones, parity bit is one
        2. Odd number of ones, parity bit is zero
        3. Should maintain an odd number of ones from the original 8 bits when applying the parity bit (odd parity)
            -Standard PC memory is odd parity
        4. If there are an odd number of ones and parity bit is set to one, system will be looking for even parity

        IMPLMENTATION: Train feed-forward neural net with back prop. to act as a parity checking system
